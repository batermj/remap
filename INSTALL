This process will improve for actual releases once the software is ready.

This is all pure python code, so you should be able to run on windows, mac osx or linux.
On linux and windows, you need to have avahi or bonjour-equivalent things installed, on osx this
just works.

> sudo python3.4 -m pip install nanomsg
> cd /tmp
> git clone git@github.com:depl0y/pybonjour-python3.git
> cd pybonjour-python3
> sudo python3.4 setup.py install

Now your machine is ready to run the code.
