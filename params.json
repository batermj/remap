{"name":"Remap","tagline":"Distributed execution platform in python","body":"### Welcome to Remap.\r\n\r\nRemap is a generic execution environment for running worker process in a distributed manner. At the moment, worker processes for map/reduce are implemented and work is being done on \"vertex\" jobs, which are worker processes for graph data.\r\n\r\nThe entire code base is written in python. It relies on nanomsg for message passing and if you want to run distributed, you need to use a distributed file system (cephfs, nfs), or copy all files to all disks.\r\n\r\nRemap is not intended for 100's of nodes (at this time), it's targeted at researchers and small installations of 1-50 nodes or so. The benefit is that it's easy to install and you should be able to have a working environment ready for a first example in about 5 minutes (once the docs improve). \r\n\r\nPlease check the [wiki](https://github.com/gtoonstra/remap/wiki) for more information","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
