<p>Remap is a generic execution environment for running worker process in a distributed manner. At the moment, worker processes for map/reduce are implemented and work is being done on "vertex" jobs, which are worker processes for graph data.</p>

<p>The entire code base is written in python. It relies on nanomsg for message passing and if you want to run distributed, you need to use a distributed file system (cephfs, nfs), or copy all files to all disks.</p>

<p>Remap is not intended for 100's of nodes (at this time), it's targeted at researchers and small installations of 1-50 nodes or so. The benefit is that it's easy to install and you should be able to have a working environment ready for a first example in about 5 minutes (once the docs improve). </p>
